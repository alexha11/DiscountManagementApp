# Discount Management App
We’re building an app that provides users with the best discounts online and in the set area. The user can set the area they live in, and the categories they are interested in. The app’s algorithm will then showcase the best discounts to the users. This helps the users to save money and time while providing the opportunity for businesses to draw in more customers and leads.

A discount management app is built by Java using Java Swing to provide user an attractive interface and PgAdmin 4 to manage data.

Back End: Java

GUI: Java Swing

Database: SQL
